Project Requirements

In this project, you will integrate a MySQL database with Python to develop an advanced Library Management System. This command-line-based application is designed to streamline the management of books and resources within a library. Your mission is to create a robust system that allows users to browse, borrow, return, and explore a collection of books while demonstrating your proficiency in database integration, SQL, and Python.

Integration with the "Library Management System" Project from Module 4 (OOP):

For this project, you will build upon the foundation laid in "Module 4: Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)." The object-oriented structure and classes you developed in that module will serve as the core framework for the Library Management System. You will leverage the classes such as Book, User, Author, and Genre that you previously designed, extending their capabilities to integrate seamlessly with the MySQL database.

Enhanced User Interface (UI) and Menu:

Create an improved, user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for the Library Management System with separate menus for each class of the system.
Welcome to the Library Management System with Database Integration!

Database Integration with MySQL:

Integrate a MySQL database into the Library Management System to store and retrieve data related to books, users, authors, and genres.
Design and create the necessary database tables to represent these entities. You will align these tables with the object-oriented structure from the previous project.
Establish connections between Python and the MySQL database for data manipulation, enhancing the persistence and scalability of your Library Management System.
Data Definition Language Scripts:

Create the necessary database tables for the Library Management System. For instance:
    Books Table:
    CREATE TABLE books (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        author_id INT,
        genre_id INT,
        isbn VARCHAR(13) NOT NULL,
        publication_date DATE,
        availability BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1,
        FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES authors(id),
        FOREIGN KEY (genre_id) REFERENCES genres(id)
    );
    Authors Table:
    CREATE TABLE authors (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        biography TEXT
    );
    Genres Table:
    CREATE TABLE genres (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        description TEXT,
        category VARCHAR(50)
    );
    Users Table:
    CREATE TABLE users (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        library_id VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL UNIQUE
    );
    Borrowed Books Table:
    CREATE TABLE borrowed_books (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        user_id INT,
        book_id INT,
        borrow_date DATE NOT NULL,
        return_date DATE,
        FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
        FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id)
    );




Menu Actions:

Implement the following actions in response to menu selections using the classes you've created:
- Adding a new book with all relevant details.
- Allowing users to borrow a book, marking it as 
Database Connection:

Establish a connection to the MySQL database using the mysql-connector-python library.
Create a database cursor to execute SQL queries. 
Functions for Data Manipulation: Create functions for adding new books, users, authors, and genres to the database.
Implement functions for updating book availability, marking books as borrowed or returned.

NOTE: Ensure that all code in your file is ready to run. This means that if someone opens your file and clicks the run button at the top, all code executes as intended. For example, if there are if statements, print statements, or for loops, they should function correctly and display output in the console as expected. If you have a function, make sure the function is called and runs. If there are classes/objects, make sure they are instantiated and the methods are called.

The goal of this note is to ensure that all code in your Python file runs smoothly and that is has been tested.
