To use, please start with the main menu. 

Here, it will ask you if you what operation you would like to go to: 
Book (1) to add new books to the library, view books, return or borrow a book, and display all books in the library; 
User (2) for handling the user operation for this program by adding new users into the library system, view users, and display all users; 
Author (3) for viewing authors, adding new authors, displaying all authors in the library system; 
and Genre (4) for adding new genres to the books (ie. Nonfiction, Fiction), view a genre, and displaying all genres that can be found in the library system.

Once you enter the operation you want to use, you will be asked to input a number for what you would like to do. The data inputted will be added into the SQL file. 

To exit the Library Management System, enter 5.
